                received by the

                for this Sweepstakes. Any personal information collected by Sponsor in connection with the Sweepstakes
                will be used

                by
                the entrant, only as described in these Official Rules. Entries made by any other individual or any

                originating at any other web site or e-mail address, including but not limited to entering service
                sites, will be

                Sweepstakes is prohibited, and any entries deemed by Sponsor, in its sole discretion, to have been
                submitted in this
                manner will be void. In the event a dispute regarding the identity of the individual who actually
                submitted a
                Submission cannot be resolved to Sponsor’s satisfaction, the affected Submission will be deemed
                ineligible. The
                Sweepstakes Entities shall not be responsible for incorrect or inaccurate entry information whether
                caused by
                Internet users or by any of the equipment or programming associated with or used in the Sweepstakes or
                by any
                technical or human error which may occur in posting videos or processing the entries in the Sweepstakes.
                The
                Sweepstakes Entities assume no responsibility or liability for any error, omission, interruption,
                deletion, theft or
                destruction, or unauthorized access to, or alteration of entries.

                <li> <strong>WINNER SELECTION AND NOTIFICATION:</strong> At the end of the Sweepstakes Period, the
                  winner(s) will be
                  randomly selected in a drawing from all eligible entries received throughout the Sweepstakes Period.
                  The drawing
                  will be conducted by Sponsor or its designee, using randomization methods selected by Sponsor in its
                  sole
                  discretion. The Winners will be subject to verification and compliance with these Official Rules. The
                  potential
                  winner will be notified by receiving their prize in their Cash App account and/or direct message on
                  the social
                  network used to enter. The Sweepstakes Entities shall have no liability for any winner notification
                  that is
                  lost, intercepted or not received by the potential winner for any reason. If any potential winner does
                  not
                  respond within the time required by Sponsor, or if the winner notification is returned as unclaimed or
                  undeliverable to any potential winner, such potential winner will forfeit his or her prize and an
                  alternate
                  winner may be selected. If any potential winner is found to be ineligible, or if he or she has not
                  complied with
                  these Official Rules or declines the prize for any reason, such potential winner will be disqualified
                  and the
                  prize may be awarded to an alternate winner. Sponsor may successively attempt to contact up to two (2)
                  potential
                  winner(s) of an applicable prize in accordance with such procedure, and if there is still no confirmed
                  winner(s)
                  of such applicable prize after such attempts have been made, if any, such prize may go unawarded.

                  All prizes
                  awarded in this

                  will be
                  allowed, except Sponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to substitute prize(s).

                  Many will enter, only one hundred and thirty-five (135) will win. Actual odds of winning depend on the
                  number of
                  eligible entries received.
                </li>
                <li><strong>GENERAL PRIZE CONDITIONS.</strong> Prizes will be awarded only if each potential prize
                  winner fully
                  complies with these Official Rules. The prizes are non-assignable and non-transferable. All details
                  and other
                  restrictions of the prizes not specified in these Official Rules will be determined by Sponsor in its
                  sole
                  discretion. Each prize winner shall be solely responsible for all federal, state and/or local taxes,
                  and the
                  reporting consequences thereof, and for any other fees or costs associated with the applicable prize.
                  Sponsor
                  may, in its sole discretion, deduct or withhold the amount of applicable tax on any cash or cash
                  equivalent
                  prize. The Sponsor may issue and file an IRS Form 1099 or equivalent tax withholding documentation for
                  the
                  retail value of any prize or other items of value transferred to each prize winner by the Sponsor in
                  accordance
                  with IRS requirements, and the Sponsor may also share such documentation with a state or local
                  government agency
                  as required by law. Refusal or failure of each prize winner to satisfy the requirements of all
                  necessary and
                  appropriate tax, withholding or other required compliance terms (including Social Security number, IRS
                  Form
                  W­8BEN, IRS Form W­9, or equivalent information), as determined by the Sponsor in its sole discretion,
                  may
                  result in each prize winner forfeiting the prizes and an alternate potential winner may be selected in
                  accordance with these Official Rules. Sponsor will award prizes subject to any applicable withholding
                  taxes, and
                  the amount of the prize transferred, as reduced by any applicable withholding taxes, will constitute
                  full
                  payment of the prize, as applicable. Each potential winner may be required to execute an Affidavit of
                  Eligibility, a Liability Release, and (where imposing such condition is legal) a Publicity Release
                  (collectively, <strong>“Prize Claim Documents”</strong>). If any potential winner fails or refuses to
                  sign and
                  return all Prize
                  Claim Documents within the time period specified by Sponsor in the prize notification, the winner may
                  be
                  disqualified and an alternate winner may be selected.

                  this
                  Sweepstakes, entrants agree to be bound by these Official Rules and the decisions of the Sponsor,
                  which shall be
                  final in all respects. The Sweepstakes is void where prohibited or restricted by law. All federal,
                  state and
                  local laws and regulations apply. By participating in this Sweepstakes and/or by accepting any prize
                  that they
                  may be awarded, entrants agree to release the Sweepstakes Entities from any and all actions, claims,
                  injury,
                  loss or damage arising in any manner, directly or indirectly, from participation in this Sweepstakes
                  and/or
                  acceptance, use or misuse of the prize. The Sweepstakes Entities shall not be liable for: (i) late,
                  lost,
                  delayed, stolen, misdirected, postage-due, incomplete, unreadable, inaccurate, garbled or
                  unintelligible
                  Submission, communications or affidavits, regardless of the method of transmission; (ii) telephone
                  system,
                  telephone or computer hardware, software or other technical or computer malfunctions, lost

                  access to
                  or alteration of Submission or other materials; (iv) any injuries, losses or damages of any kind
                  caused from
                  participation in the Sweepstakes; or (v) any printing, typographical, administrative or technological
                  errors in
                  any materials associated with the Sweepstakes. The Sweepstakes Entities disclaim any liability for
                  damage to any
                  computer system resulting from participating in, or accessing or downloading information in connection
                  with this
                  Sweepstakes, and reserve the right, in their sole discretion, to cancel, modify or suspend the
                  Sweepstakes
                  should a virus, bug, computer problem, unauthorized intervention or other causes beyond Sponsor’s
                  control,
                  corrupt the administration, security or proper running of the Sweepstakes. Sponsor may prohibit you
                  from
                  participating in the Sweepstakes if, in its sole discretion, Sponsor determines you are attempting to
                  undermine
                  the legitimate operation of the Sweepstakes by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair
                  behavior or
                  with the intent to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass any other entrants or Sponsor representatives and
                  Sponsor
                  reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from any such person to the fullest extent
                  permitted by
                  law. No mechanically reproduced, illegible, incomplete, forged, software-generated or other automated
                  multiple
                  entries will be accepted. If a dispute as to the identity of the individual who actually submitted a
                  Submission
                  cannot be resolved to Sponsor’s satisfaction, the affected Submission may be deemed ineligible.
                  Sponsor reserves
                  the right to modify, extend, suspend, or terminate the Sweepstakes if it determines, in its sole
                  discretion,
                  that the Sweepstakes is technically impaired or corrupted or that fraud or technical problems,
                  failures or
                  malfunctions or other causes beyond Sponsor’s control have destroyed or severely undermined or to any
                  degree
                  impaired the integrity, administration, security, proper play and/or feasibility of the Sweepstakes as
                  contemplated herein. In the event an insufficient number of eligible entries are received and/or
                  Sponsor is
                  prevented from awarding prizes or continuing with the Sweepstakes as contemplated herein by any event
                  beyond its
                  control, including but not limited to fire, flood, natural or man-made epidemic of health of other
                  means,
                  pandemic, earthquake, explosion, labor dispute or strike, act of God or public enemy, satellite or
                  equipment
                  failure, riot or civil disturbance, terrorist threat or activity, war (declared or undeclared) or any
                  federal
                  state or local government law, order, or regulation, public health crisis, order of any court or
                  jurisdiction,
                  or other cause not reasonably within Sponsor’s control (each a <strong>“Force Majeure”</strong> event
                  or
                  occurrence), then
                  Sponsor shall have the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the Sweepstakes. If the Sweepstakes is
                  terminated
                  before the designated end date, Sponsor may (if possible) select the winners in a random drawing from
                  all
                  eligible, non-suspect Submissions received as of the date of the event giving rise to the termination.
                  Inclusion
                  in such drawing shall be each entrant’s sole and exclusive remedy under such circumstances. Only the
                  type and
                  quantity of prizes described in these Official Rules will be awarded. If, for any reason, more bona
                  fide winners
                  come forward seeking to claim prizes in excess of the number of each type of prize set forth in these
                  Official
                  Rules, the winners, or remaining winners, as the case may be, of the advertised number of prizes
                  available in
                  the prize category in question may be selected in a random drawing from among all persons making
                  purportedly
                  valid claims for such prize(s). Inclusion in such drawing shall be each entrant’s sole and exclusive
                  remedy
                  under such circumstances. These Official Rules cannot be modified or amended in any way except in a
                  written
                  document issued in accordance with law by a duly authorized representative of Sponsor. The invalidity
                  or
                  unenforceability of any provision of these rules shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
                  any other
                  provision. In the event that any provision is determined to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable or
                  illegal,
                  these rules shall otherwise remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with their terms as
                  if the
                  invalid or illegal provision were not contained herein.
                </li>
                <li><strong>NATURE OF RELATIONSHIP/WAIVER OF EQUITABLE RELIEF.</strong> Each entrant hereby acknowledges
                  and agrees
                  that the relationship between the entrant and the Sweepstakes Entities is not a confidential,
                  fiduciary, or
                  other special relationship, and that the entrant’s decision to provide the entrant’s Submission to
                  Sponsor for
                  purposes of the Sweepstakes does not place the Sweepstakes Entities in a position that is any
                  different from the
                  position held by members of the general public with regard to elements of the entrant’s Submission.
                  Each entrant
                  understands and acknowledges that the Sweepstakes Entities have wide access to ideas, stories,
                  designs, and
                  other literary materials, and that new ideas are constantly being submitted to it or being developed
                  by their
                  own employees. Each entrant also acknowledges that many ideas may be competitive with, similar or
                  identical to
                  the Submission and/or each other in theme, idea, plot, format or other respects. Each entrant
                  acknowledges and
                  agrees that such entrant will not be entitled to any compensation as a result of any Sweepstakes
                  Entity’s use of
                  any such similar or identical material. Each entrant acknowledges and agrees that the Sweepstakes
                  Entities do
                  not now and shall not have in the future any duty or liability, direct or indirect, vicarious,
                  contributory, or
                  otherwise, with respect to the infringement or protection of the copyright in and to the Submission.
                  Finally,
                  each entrant acknowledges that, with respect to any claim by entrant relating to or arising out of a
                  Sweepstakes
                  Entity’s actual or alleged exploitation or use of any Submission or other material submitted in
                  connection with
                  the Sweepstakes, the damage, if any, thereby caused to the applicable entrant will not be irreparable
                  or
                  otherwise sufficient to entitle such entrant to seek injunctive or other equitable relief and
                  entrant’s rights
                  and remedies in any such event shall be strictly limited to the right to recover damages, if any, in
                  an action
                  at law.</li>
                <li> <strong>NO OBLIGATION TO USE.</strong> The Sweepstakes Entities shall have no obligation (express
                  or implied)
                  to use any Submission, or to otherwise exploit any Submission or, if commenced, to continue the
                  distribution or
                  exploitation thereof, and the Sweepstakes Entities may at any time abandon the use of the Submission
                  for any
                  reason, with or without legal justification or excuse, and entrants shall not be entitled to any
                  damages or
                  other relief by reason thereof.
                </li>
                <li> <strong>FURTHER DOCUMENTATION.</strong> If Sponsor shall desire to secure additional assignments
                  from the
                  entrant(s), or other documents as Sponsor may reasonably require in order to effectuate the purposes
                  and intents
                  of these Official Rules, then each entrant agrees to sign the same upon Sponsor’s request therefor.

                  THAT WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF ANY OTHER STATE’S LAWS.As a condition of participating in this
                  Sweepstakes,
                  entrants agree that any and all disputes which cannot be resolved between the parties, and causes of
                  action
                  arising out of or in connection with this Sweepstakes, shall be resolved individually through binding
                  arbitration, without resort to any form of class action, in accordance with the arbitration provision
                  set forth
                  below.</li>
                <li><strong>ARBITRATION PROVISION.</strong> By participating in this Sweepstakes, each entrant agrees:
                  (i) that any
                  and all disputes the entrant may have with, or claims entrant may have against, the Sweepstakes
                  Entities
                  relating to, arising out of or connected in any way with (a) the Sweepstakes, (b) the awarding or
                  redemption of
                  any prize, and/or (c) the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate,
                  will be
                  resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by JAMS and conducted before a sole
                  arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; (ii) this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a
                  transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act
                  (<strong>“FAA”</strong>), 9
                  U.S.C. §§ 1-16; (iii) the arbitration shall be held in Atlanta, Georgia; (iv) the arbitrator’s
                  decision shall be
                  controlled by the terms and conditions of these Official Rules and any of the other agreements
                  referenced herein
                  that the applicable entrant may have entered into in connection with the Sweepstakes; (v) the
                  arbitrator shall
                  apply Georgia law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor
                  claims of
                  privilege recognized at law; (vi) there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a
                  class or
                  representative basis, arbitration can decide only entrant’s and/or Sponsor’s individual claims; the
                  arbitrator
                  may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated;
                  (vii) the
                  arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive damages against the entrant or Sponsor; (viii)
                  if the
                  entrant is able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the
                  costs of
                  litigation, Sponsor will pay as much of entrant’s filing and hearing fees in connection with the
                  arbitration as
                  the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive; and (ix) with
                  the
                  exception of subpart (vi) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid,
                  unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of JAMS, then the balance of this
                  arbitration
                  provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the
                  invalid,
                  unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart (vi)
                  is found to
                  be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null
                  and void,
                  and neither entrant nor Sponsor shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute. For more information on

                </li>
                <p><strong>Limit: One (1) Submission per eligible entrant.</strong> Submissions must be received by the

                  submitted for
                  consideration. Any Submission that is considered by Sponsor in its sole and absolute discretion to
                  violate the
                  Submission Requirements, in whole or in part, may be disqualified and will not be eligible for entry.
                </p>
                <p>Any personal information collected by Sponsor in connection with the Contest will be used in
                  accordance with
                  Sponsor’s privacy policy located at: <a
                    href="https://www.auntieannes.com/privacy">https://www.auntieannes.com/privacy</a>. Entry must be
                  made by
                  the entrant,
                  only as
                  described in these Official Rules. Entries made by any other individual or any entity, and/or
                  originating at any
                  other web site or e-mail address, including but not limited to entering service sites, will be
                  declared invalid
                  and
                  disqualified for this Contest. Tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Contest is
                  prohibited
                  and
                  any entries deemed by Sponsor, in its sole discretion, to have been submitted in this manner will be
                  void. In
                  the
                  event a dispute regarding the identity of the individual who actually submitted a Submission cannot be
                  resolved
                  to
                  Sponsor’s satisfaction, the affected Submission will be deemed ineligible. The Contest Entities shall
                  not be
                  responsible for incorrect or inaccurate entry information whether caused by Internet users or by any
                  of the
                  equipment or programming associated with or used in the Contest or by any technical or human error
                  which may
                  occur
                  in posting videos or processing the entries in the Contest. The Contest Entities assume no
                  responsibility or
                  liability for any error, omission, interruption, deletion, theft or destruction, or unauthorized
                  access to, or
                  alteration of entries.</p>
                <li><strong>WINNER SELECTION AND NOTIFICATION:</strong> Assuming a sufficient number of eligible
                  Submissions are
                  received, at the end
                  of the Contest Period, a judge or group of judges selected by the Sponsor (in either case, the
                  <strong>“Judging
                    Panel”</strong>)
                  will review the Submissions that have been received and select eleven (11) winners (each, a
                  <strong>“Winner”</strong>) based on
                  the following criteria: (i) quality and entertainment value of brand love – showcasing a love of
                  Auntie Anne’s
                  products/brand (50%); (ii) creativity (30%); and (iii) appropriateness of why the money is
                  needed/wanted to the
                  public image of the Contest Entities (20%) (the <strong>“Judging Criteria”</strong>). The Winner with
                  the
                  highest score based on
                  the Judging Criteria will be the Grand Prize Winner. In the event of a tie, the Submission with the
                  highest
                  score in the “brand love” category will be declared a Winner.
                </li>

                <p>The potential winners will be subject to verification and compliance with these Official Rules. The
                  potential
                  winner will be notified by direct message on the social network used to enter and must respond to that
                  message
                  with the requested contact information within 24 hours after the notice was issued. The Contest
                  Entities shall
                  have no liability for any winner notification that is lost, intercepted or not received by the
                  potential winner
                  for any reason. If any potential winner does not respond within the time required by Sponsor, or if
                  the winner
                  notification is returned as unclaimed or undeliverable to any potential winner, such potential winner
                  will
                  forfeit his or her prize and an alternate winner may be selected. If any potential winner is found to
                  be
                  ineligible, or if he or she has not complied with these Official Rules or declines the prize for any
                  reason,
                  such potential winner will be disqualified and the prize may be awarded to an alternate winner.
                  Sponsor may
                  successively attempt to contact up to two (2) potential winner(s) of an applicable prize in accordance
                  with such
                  procedure, and if there is still no confirmed winner(s) of such applicable prize after such attempts
                  have been
                  made, if any, such prize may go unawarded.</p>

                <li><strong>PRIZES.</strong> Eleven (11) prizes are available. Ten (10) Winners will each receive
                  $1,000.00 and one
                  (1) Grand Prize
                  Winner will receive $10,000.00. Total Approximate Retail Value (<strong>“ARV”</strong>) for all prizes
                  is
                  $20,000.00. All prizes
                  awarded in this Contest will be provided to the Winners via the Cash App.

                  No alternative or substitution of prizes will be allowed, except Sponsor reserves the right in its
                  sole
                  discretion to substitute prize(s).</li>
                <li><strong>GENERAL PRIZE CONDITIONS.</strong> Prizes will be awarded only if each potential prize
                  winner fully
                  complies with these
                  Official Rules. The prizes are non-assignable and non-transferable. All details and other restrictions
                  of the
                  prizes not specified in these Official Rules will be determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion.
                  Each prize
                  winner shall be solely responsible for all federal, state and/or local taxes, and the reporting
                  consequences
                  thereof, and for any other fees or costs associated with the applicable prize. Sponsor may, in its
                  sole
                  discretion, deduct or withhold the amount of applicable tax on any cash or cash equivalent prize. The
                  Sponsor
                  will issue and file an IRS Form 1099 or equivalent tax withholding documentation for the retail value
                  of any
                  prize or other items of value transferred to each prize winner by the Sponsor in accordance with IRS
                  requirements, and the Sponsor may also share such documentation with a state or local government
                  agency as
                  required by law. Refusal or failure of each prize winner to satisfy the requirements of all necessary
                  and
                  appropriate tax, withholding or other required compliance terms (including Social Security number, IRS
                  Form
                  W­8BEN, IRS Form W­9, or equivalent information), as determined by the Sponsor in its sole discretion,
                  may
                  result in each prize winner forfeiting the prizes and an alternate potential winner may be selected in
                  accordance with these Official Rules. Sponsor will award prizes subject to any applicable withholding
                  taxes, and
                  the amount of the prize transferred, as reduced by any applicable withholding taxes, will constitute
                  full
                  payment of the prize, as applicable. Each potential winner will be required to execute an Affidavit of
                  Eligibility, a Liability Release, and (where imposing such condition is legal) a Publicity Release
                  (collectively, <strong>“Prize Claim Documents”</strong>). If any potential winner fails or refuses to
                  sign and
                  return all Prize
                  Claim Documents within the time period specified by Sponsor in the prize notification, the winner may
                  be
                  disqualified and an alternate winner may be selected.</li>

                  disclaim any liability for damage to any computer system resulting from participating in, or accessing
                  or
                  downloading information in connection with this Contest, and reserve the right, in their sole
                  discretion, to
                  cancel, modify or suspend the Contest should a virus, bug, computer problem, unauthorized intervention
                  or other
                  causes beyond Sponsor’s control, corrupt the administration, security or proper running of the
                  Contest. Sponsor
                  may prohibit you from participating in the Contest if, in its sole discretion, Sponsor determines you
                  are
                  attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Contest by cheating, hacking, deception, or
                  any other
                  unfair behavior or with the intent to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass any other entrants or Sponsor
                  representatives and Sponsor reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from any such person
                  to the
                  fullest extent permitted by law. No mechanically reproduced, illegible, incomplete, forged,
                  software-generated
                  or other automated multiple entries will be accepted. If a dispute as to the identity of the
                  individual who
                  actually submitted a Submission cannot be resolved to Sponsor’s satisfaction, the affected Submission
                  may be
                  deemed ineligible. Sponsor reserves the right to modify, extend, suspend, or terminate the Contest if
                  it
                  determines, in its sole discretion, that the Contest is technically impaired or corrupted or that
                  fraud or
                  technical problems, failures or malfunctions or other causes beyond Sponsor’s control have destroyed
                  or severely
                  undermined or to any degree impaired the integrity, administration, security, proper play and/or
                  feasibility of
                  the Contest as contemplated herein. In the event an insufficient number of eligible entries are
                  received and/or
                  Sponsor is prevented from awarding prizes or continuing with the Contest as contemplated herein by any
                  event
                  beyond its control, including but not limited to fire, flood, natural or man-made epidemic of health

                  or
                  jurisdiction, or other cause not reasonably within Sponsor’s control (each a <strong>“Force

                  event or
                  occurrence), then Sponsor shall have the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the Contest. If the
                  Contest is
                  terminated before the designated end date, Sponsor may (if possible) select the winner from all
                  eligible,
                  non-suspect entries received as of the date of the event giving rise to the termination. Only the type
                  and
                  quantity of prizes described in these Official Rules will be awarded. These Official Rules cannot be
                  modified or
                  amended in any way except in a written document issued in accordance with law by a duly authorized
                  representative of Sponsor. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of these rules shall
                  not affect
                  the validity or enforceability of any other provision. In the event that any provision is determined
                  to be
                  invalid or otherwise unenforceable or illegal, these rules shall otherwise remain in effect and shall
                  be
                  construed in accordance with their terms as if the invalid or illegal provision were not contained
                  herein. </li>
                <li><strong>NATURE OF RELATIONSHIP/WAIVER OF EQUITABLE RELIEF.</strong> Each entrant hereby acknowledges
                  and agrees
                  that the
                  relationship between the entrant and the Contest Entities is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other
                  special
                  relationship, and that the entrant’s decision to provide the entrant’s Submission to Sponsor for
                  purposes of the
                  Contest does not place the Contest Entities in a position that is any different from the position held
                  by
                  members of the general public with regard to elements of the entrant’s Submission. Each entrant
                  understands and
                  acknowledges that the Contest Entities have wide access to ideas, stories, designs, and other literary
                  materials, and that new ideas are constantly being submitted to it or being developed by their own
                  employees.
                  Each entrant also acknowledges that many ideas may be competitive with, similar or identical to the
                  Submission
                  and/or each other in theme, idea, plot, format or other respects. Each entrant acknowledges and agrees
                  that such
                  entrant will not be entitled to any compensation as a result of any Contest Entity’s use of any such
                  similar or
                  identical material. Each entrant acknowledges and agrees that the Contest Entities do not now and
                  shall not have
                  in the future any duty or liability, direct or indirect, vicarious, contributory, or otherwise, with
                  respect to
                  the infringement or protection of the copyright in and to the Submission. Finally, each entrant
                  acknowledges
                  that, with respect to any claim by entrant relating to or arising out of a Contest Entity’s actual or
                  alleged
                  exploitation or use of any Submission or other material submitted in connection with the Contest, the
                  damage, if
                  any, thereby caused to the applicable entrant will not be irreparable or otherwise sufficient to
                  entitle such
                  entrant to seek injunctive or other equitable relief and entrant’s rights and remedies in any such
                  event shall
                  be strictly limited to the right to recover damages, if any, in an action at law.</li>
                <li><strong>NO OBLIGATION TO USE.</strong> The Contest Entities shall have no obligation (express or
                  implied) to use
                  any Submission,
                  or to otherwise exploit any Submission or, if commenced, to continue the distribution or exploitation
                  thereof,
                  and the Contest Entities may at any time abandon the use of the Submission for any reason, with or
                  without legal
                  justification or excuse, and entrants shall not be entitled to any damages or other relief by reason
                  thereof.
                </li>

                <li> <strong>FURTHER DOCUMENTATION.</strong> If Sponsor shall desire to secure additional assignments
                  from the
                  entrant(s), or other
                  documents as Sponsor may reasonably require in order to effectuate the purposes and intents of these
                  Official
                  Rules, then each entrant agrees to sign the same upon Sponsor’s request therefor. </li>

                  OF THE
                  STATE OF GEORGIA WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OF LAW OF CONFLICT OF LAW RULES OR PROVISIONS
                  THAT WOULD
                  CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF ANY OTHER STATE’S LAWS. As a condition of participating in this Contest,
                  entrants agree
                  that any and all disputes which cannot be resolved between the parties, and causes of action arising
                  out of or
                  in connection with this Contest, shall be resolved individually through binding arbitration, without
                  resort to
                  any form of class action, in accordance with the arbitration provision set forth below.</li>

                <li><strong>ARBITRATION PROVISION.</strong> By participating in this Contest, each entrant agrees: (i)
                  that any and
                  all disputes the
                  entrant may have with, or claims entrant may have against, the Contest Entities relating to, arising
                  out of or
                  connected in any way with (a) the Contest, (b) the awarding or redemption of any prize, and/or (c) the
                  determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, will be resolved
                  exclusively by
                  final and binding arbitration administered by JAMS and conducted before a sole arbitrator in
                  accordance with the
                  rules of JAMS; (ii) this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate
                  commerce,
                  and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (<strong>“FAA”</strong>), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16; (iii)
                  the
                  arbitration shall be
                  held in Atlanta, Georgia; (iv) the arbitrator’s decision shall be controlled by the terms and
                  conditions of
                  these Official Rules and any of the other agreements referenced herein that the applicable entrant may
                  have
                  entered into in connection with the Contest; (v) the arbitrator shall apply Georgia law consistent
                  with the FAA
                  and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; (vi)
                  there shall
                  be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, arbitration can
                  decide only
                  entrant’s and/or Sponsor’s individual claims; the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of
                  other
                  persons or parties who may be similarly situated; (vii) the arbitrator shall not have the power to
                  award
                  punitive damages against the entrant or Sponsor; (viii) if the entrant is able to demonstrate that the
                  costs of
                  arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Sponsor will pay as much of
                  entrant’s
                  filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to
                  prevent the
                  arbitration from being cost-prohibitive; and (ix) with the exception of subpart (vi) above, if any
                  part of this
                  arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with
                  the rules
                  of JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed
                  in
                  accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not
                  contained
                  herein. If, however, subpart (vi) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety
                  of this
                  arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither entrant nor Sponsor shall be entitled to
                  arbitrate
                  their dispute. For more information on JAMS and/or the rules of JAMS, visit their website at <a
